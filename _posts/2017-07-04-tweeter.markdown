As part of the course curriculum at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/), we dove into databases as well as basic jQuery by developing a twitter clone that leverages a Node.js backend and storing tweets to be later retrieved on a single page through MongoDB.

A user is able to compose a tweet and see tweets other users have made
