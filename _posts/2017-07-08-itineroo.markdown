I attended a coding [bootcamp](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) right out of university in hopes of switching fields from Kinesiology to the world of tech. At the cumulation of the bootcamp I partnered up with another future software developer to create a trip planning app built to allow friends and family to collaborate, vote and comment on a desired itinerary for any city using Google Places and Google Maps API.

We also happened to win the "People's Choice Award at Lighthouse Labs Demo Day"

* Front-end built using HTML/CSS/SASS, React, Bootstrap, Materialize, Javascript, AJAX
* Backend was built using Node.js, Express, and PostreSQL,
* Google Places & Maps API was used to fetch top 20 locations from desired city.
