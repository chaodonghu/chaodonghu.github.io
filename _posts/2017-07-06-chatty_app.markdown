As part of the course curriculum at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/), we dove into real time live applications and component changing by utilizing React and Websockets to implement a basic chat app that supports the real time updating of state between multiple users at a time.

#### Project Walkthrough

Each user is able to send a chat message that is subsequently broadcasted to all connected users. Connected users are able to paste in urls ending with jpg, png, gif in a message to display the images in the chat.

When a user changes their username, all connected users are notified of the username change. Additionally once a new user is connected, the 'users online' counter will be incremented. Every user has a color associated with their username, this color stays constant even when the username changes.
