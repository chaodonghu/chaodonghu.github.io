I wanted to dabble into game development however didn't want to start with a heavy game engine like Unity or Unreal engine. I decided to look into web games and came across a javascript library called [phaser.js](https://phaser.io/).

It's a pretty cool open source framework to make canvas and WebGL powered browser games. I decided to dabble into some sprite making and make some Drake themed classics.
