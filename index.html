<h3>Hi I'm Dong! ðŸ””</h3>
<p>
  I'm currently a fullstack developer at
  <a href="https://www.applyboard.com/" target="_blank">ApplyBoard</a>, an
  online platform that streamlines the study abroad process by connecting
  students, recruitment partners, and partner schools on a single platform.
</p>
<h4>My story ðŸ“š</h4>
<p>
  Prior to being a developer I had dreams of pursuing pediatrics and graduated
  with a degree in Kinesiology at the University of Waterloo.
</p>
<p>
  I've had the pleasure contributing to multiple publications and presenting
  posters at several conferences spanning the domains of spinal cord injury,
  pharmaceuticals and the elderly.
</p>
<p>
  A list of abstracts and poster presentations i've contributed to can be found
  <a href="/2017/07/08/poster-presentations/" target="_blank">here.</a>
</p>
<p>
  I decided to make the switch to software development at the end of my
  undergrad after being immersed in it by the abundance of opportunities at the
  University of Waterloo.
