      <h3>Hi I'm Dong! ðŸ””</h3>
      <p>
        I'm currently a fullstack developer at
        <a href="https://www.applyboard.com/" target="_blank">ApplyBoard</a>, an
        online platform that streamlines the study abroad process by connecting
        students, recruitment partners, and partner schools on a single
        platform.
      </p>
      <h4>My story ðŸ“š</h4>
      <p>
        Prior to being a developer I had dreams of pursuing pediatrics and
        graduated with a degree in Kinesiology at the University of Waterloo.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had the pleasure to be able to contribute to several publications
        and poster presentations related to healthcare that include domains
        related to spinal cord injury, pharmaceuticals and the elderly. A list
        of abstracts and poster presentations i've contributed to can be found
        <a href="/2017/07/08/poster-presentations/" target="_blank">here.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I decided to make the switch to software development at the
        end of my undergrad after being immersed by the abundance of
        opportunities presented at the University of Waterloo and surrounding
        <a href="https://www.communitech.ca/" target="_blank">area</a>.
