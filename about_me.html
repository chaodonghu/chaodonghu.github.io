<h5>Hi I'm Dong.</h5>

<p>
  I'm currently a fullstack developer at
  <a href="https://www.applyboard.com/">ApplyBoard</a>, an online platform that
  enables international students and recruitment partners to apply to their
  dream school across the world.
</p>
<p>
  I made this website in order to archive all my projects as well as utilize it
  as a blog to photodump my travels and any ideas that come to mind.
</p>
<p>
  There's alot I don't know and i'm sure you probably know something I don't. If
  you'd like to connect, contact me and we can chat!
</p>
